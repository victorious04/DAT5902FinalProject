# DAT5902FinalProject
This is the repository for DAT5902. All work within the repository is my own and is coded and evaluated to the best of my ability.

This project explores the relationship between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy across countries and income groups. Using data from Our World in Data (2016), it employs statistical and visual analysis to uncover global trends, disparities, and policy implications.

Key questions addressed include:

1. Is there a relationship between GDP per Capita and life expectancy?
2. How does the relationship vary across low-, middle-, and high-income countries?
3. How does this differ across continents?
   
The analysis utilizes Python for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical testing, including scatter plots, bar charts, correlation analysis, and linear regression.
